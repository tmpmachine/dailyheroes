# Installation
1. Clone this repository to your file system. Extract the files if you download it as .zip.
2. Open Chrome, then go to `chrome://extensions/` and turn on `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked`, then browse and select dailyheroes directory to install the extension.

Additional setup (recommended) :
1. You may want to pin dailyheroes extension because it will change its icon to countdown (in minutes) when a timer is running.
2. Set shortcut at `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` for easier access. I recommend `Ctrl+Shift+Space`.
